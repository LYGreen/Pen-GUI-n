# Pen-GUI-n
I like to use Xournal++, but I wish there was a way to customize hotkeys for pen(s), eraser(s), and higlighter(s). This plugin adds that functionality. It is also my first (of many) Lua projects.
<br>
# Installation
```bash
cd /usr/share/xournalpp/plugins/
git clone "https://github.com/Mr-FuzzyPenguin/Pen-GUI-n.git"
```
Simple as that.

# WIP (ordered in order of importance):

- [ ] Config file
- [ ] GUI to edit custom keybinds
