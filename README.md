# Pen-GUI-n
I like to use Xournal++, but I wish there was a way to customize hotkeys for pen(s), eraser(s), and higlighter(s). This plugin adds that functionality. It is also my first (of potentially many) Lua projects.
<br/ >
# Installation
```bash
cd ~/.config/xournalpp/plugins/
git clone "https://github.com/Mr-FuzzyPenguin/Pen-GUI-n.git"
```
Simple as that.

# WIP (ordered in order of importance):
- [ ] Read a config file (coming in 1.5+)
- [ ] Have a GUI to edit custom keybinds (coming in 2.0+)

Added a bunch of accelerators for the (P)en tool, (E)raser, highlighter (V), (R)ectangular and (S)urface/squiggly selection, te(X), and (T)ext tools.
